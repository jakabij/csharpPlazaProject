Firstly the program asks you to create a plaza instance.
Go on this way, because the exit thing is not a big show!

To work properly go for a new shop first (press 2). If you don't do it fine... you just don't have anything to work with.

If you added one you can test the functions.
Enter a shop (press 4) for other options.
I recommend you to add here a product for the shop too and test with it. Otherwise you will come up with some exceptions.

Best regards! ;)
